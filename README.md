# Implicit quantile networks for jet emulation

This repository contains code to train implicit quantile networks to model joint distributions
 - autoregressively, using TensorFlow, and
 - independently, using pyTorch

See each folder for installation, training, and evaluation instructions.

It also contains the code necesary to generate the datasets used in training.

This repositor contains the code to reproduce the work presented in *Implicit Quantile Networks for Emulation in High Energy
