# Implicit quantile networks for jet emulation

This repository contains code to train implicit quantile networks to model joint distributions
 - autoregressively, using TensorFlow, and
 - independently, using pyTorch

See each folder for installation, training, and evaluation instructions.

This repositor contains the code to reproduce the work presented in *Implicit Quantile Networks for Emulation in High Energy
Physics* B. Kronheim, M. P. Kucher, H. B. Prosper, R. Ramanujan, A. Al Kadhim (2022)
